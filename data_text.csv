0,"Hardy Reef, QLD"," the reef is 60km out from shute harbour/airlie beach how to see it for yourself? most of the great barrier reef’s attractions lie under the surface, of course, and hardy reef in its southern section (further from shore and therefore less trafficked) is a great place to see them. expect a stunning array of polychromatic hard and soft corals, a couple of hundred fish species – including tusk fish, trevally, snapper, cuttlefish, moray eels, barracuda, unicorn fish, surgeonfish, angelfish, wrasse, gropers – not to mention starfish, giant clams and even the occasional passing whale. but you’ll have to take to the air to see this sight and the other major local attraction, heart reef, which is in a protected area off-limits to underwater tourists. hardy reef features fantasea’s permanent reefworld pontoon, where you can snorkel, dive, do a semi-submersible tour and even stay the night, while further out is cruise whitsundays’ knuckle reef pontoon. both offer helicopter flights starting from $110/$129 for 10 minutes. this image was taken from a chopper at midday. those with deeper pockets can also fly out from the whitsunday islands or the mainland – by helicopter or seaplane – in 30 minutes to save themselves the long boat ride. why i love it “hardy reef is probably my favourite part of the great barrier reef, because it features beautiful turquoise colours and incredible textured patterns. this particular view holds significance to me because it was my first ever helicopter flight and aerial photo shoot.” – mark gray "
1,"Burra Homestead, SA"," just outside burra, 160km north of adelaide how to see it for yourself? famous to midnight oil fans for featuring on the cover of diesel and dust – also shot by ken duncan – this old homestead at the foot of the mt lofty ranges was abandoned long ago by smallholders unable to sustain a livelihood on this rain-starved land. ironically, this iconic scene of golden rural australia is looking a lot greener now after all the recent rain – if you visit in september-october, you might even find it surrounded by canola in bloom, though the crops are rotated. hence you might not see this this exact scene. drive north on the barrier highway for 6km from the centre of the historic town of burra – once a major copper mining centre and also a location used in the filming of breaker morant. you’ll see the homestead on your right about 100m off the road. but bear in mind it’s on private property, so unless you ask permission for a closer look, you can only view it from the road. the building faces west so visit in the late afternoon to see it in its best light. why i love it “i first immortalised this old farmhouse in my early days as a landscape photographer. the original shot became one of my most famous images when it was used on diesel and dust. how it tickled me when i returned to the area more than ten years later and the local tourist office gave me directions to ‘the midnight oil house’!” – ken duncan "
2,"The Twelve Apostles, VIC"," near princetown, 200km down the great ocean road from geelong, or 270km south-west of melbourne how to see it for yourself? constant erosion by wind and sea of the limestone cliffs formed caves and then bridges; when these collapsed – the fate of the nearby island archway in 2009 and london bridge in 1990 – they left these stacks up to 45m high isolated offshore. they’re a highlight of the great ocean road – probably australia’s most scenic coastal drive. note that you can shave 50km off the drive from melbourne by taking the inland route via the princes highway, but then you’d miss out on the other attractions. formerly called the sow and piglets until being renamed the 12 apostles in the 1920s, they have never numbered 12 – though it depends who’s counting. continuing erosion means they could topple at any time, but you can currently see seven stacks to the west of the 12 apostles viewpoint, and two more to the east. sunrise – the time this shot was taken – offers the most dramatic lighting from the viewpoint, followed by sunset. and visit at dawn or hang around after the sun goes down to see little penguins – they come ashore each evening on the beach at the base of the 70m cliffs. if you want to get to the water’s edge yourself, the nearest access is via gibsons steps, 1km to the east, but access is restricted. why i love it “people are not normally allowed onto this beach because of the penguin colony, but i was granted special permission and had to be accompanied by a ranger. we arrived in darkness to position ourselves for sunrise; at first light the penguins began to prepare to go out fishing. first one of the birds came down to the water’s edge to make sure everything was ok, then he signalled to a little troupe of followers to join him. this was mirrored down the entire beach as hundreds and hundreds of penguins began their daily routine. some of thepenguins actually walked within inches of my tripod. after they had all departed, the moon began to sink towards the horizon and its silvery light illuminated the scene before me.” – ken duncan "
3,"Bungle Bungle Ranges, WA"," purnululu national park, wa, 250km south of kununurra how to see it for yourself? you’ll be speechless within seconds of take-off as you’re introduced to purnululu national park’s bungle bungle range, a carved 350 million-year-old landscape of gorges and pools surrounded by a soft, green blanket of grassland. since its discovery in the 1980s, what was once australia’s best-kept secret is now internationally recognised as a top destination. because most of the area is inaccessible by car or foot, the best way to appreciate the tiger-striped beehive domes is from a plane or helicopter. why i love it no matter how many times you soar over the bungle bungles, they always look different, depending on the time of year, the time of day and prevailing weather conditions. it’s a place you could visit time and again, and we urge you to do it at least once in your lifetime. "
4,"Hill Inlet, Whitsunday Island"," east coast of whitsunday island, the largest island in the group offshore from airlie beach, between rockhampton and mackay how to see it for yourself? access to whitsunday island, one of the undeveloped islands in the group that forms the whitsunday islands national park, is usually by boat from airlie beach/shute harbour or via one of the other island resorts, but there are helicopter/seaplane joy flights if you want to see it from the air like this. the whitsundays offer a range of accommodation options from camping to qualia, hamilton island’s luxury resort, but the perfect way to experience the islands, reefs and the swirling turquoise water and pure white sands of hill inlet is on your own yacht – look into skippered or bareboat hires. you can anchor overnight at tongue bay (at the left of this picture), and walk up to a lookout at tongue point for a view over the inlet. visit at low tide to see the best patterns. whitehaven beach stretches 7km south from hill inlet and is also worth pointing a camera at: it’s one of australia’s most beautiful beaches, boasting sand of such purity you could make optical glass from it. why i love it “great swirls of pure white silica sand sweep and curl through crystal clear waters. the patterns, like those of a kaleidoscope, are everchanging; churned by a moving shaft of silica out to sea. this, to me, is one of the most beautiful locations on the planet.” – ken duncan "
5,"Craig’s Hut, Mt Stirling, VIC"," in the australian alps, 230km north-west of melbourne how to see it for yourself? drive up towards mt buller from mansfield, then take a left after the mirimbah tollgate onto stirling road. then it’s 8km of sealed road to telephone box junction, the limit for vehicles in winter. but in the warmer months you can continue to the gravel by 2wd circuit road: turn left and drive for 20km to the junction with clear hills track. from there it’s a 20-minute walk or short 4wd drive to craig’s hut. the spectacular, minimally developed mt stirling attracts cross-country skiers, horse riders and bushwalkers. the original craig’s hut, inspired by those used by cattle drovers for temporary shelter, was built for the movie the man from snowy river (1982) but burnt down in a bushfire. this replica – with a tin rather than bark roof – was completed in 2008. the shot was taken at sunrise. there are a couple of hundred huts (or their ruins) scattered through the australian alps; some built for fishermen, skiers, miners or hydro workers as well as graziers. most are only accessible on foot/bike/horseback. wallace hut near falls creek (see number 26 in this list) is thought to be the oldest, built in 1889. a further 2km down the bogong high plains road is cope hut, built for skiers in 1929, while fry’s hut in the howqua hills historic area, 34km from mansfield, is another good example. see the sites below for more information. why i love it “i spent three days camping in the snow at craig’s hut with a good friend a few years ago and it was an experience we will never forget. the peace and solitude were incredibly unique. we drank ice-cold water from a nearby stream and built a campfire from fallen tree branches. every night we lay awake in our tents trying to figure out what kind of high-country animals made such terrifying noises! perhaps the rumours of wild cats and panthers have some credibility after all.” – mark gray "
6,"Remarkable Rocks, Kangaroo Island, SA"," kangaroo island, which lies 15km off south australia’s fleurieu peninsula how to see it for yourself? ki has plenty of natural attractions (see issue #36) – beaches, wildlife, seafood, sheer peace – but these rock formations in flinders chase national park, in the south-western corner of the 150km-long island, are a big draw. the granite boulders, decorated with orange lichen, sit atop a bald rock outcrop that slopes down into the sea, and have been sculpted with tafoni (deep cavities) – by wind, rain and sea spray. the classic shot of the rocks is taken facing north, but this group is to the south-west. you can get to ki by car ferry or plane. why i love it “the balance of the formation really fascinated me; i was especially taken with the ‘open arms’ of the larger stone at the front right of the group. it was as if it was protecting the little rock beneath it, like the enshrouding wings of an angel.” – ken duncan "
7,"Cradle Mountain, TAS"," cradle mountain-mt field np, 90km south of devonport how to see it for yourself? from dove lake car park, it’s a two-and-a-halfhour return walk up to marions lookout for good views of cradle mountain. why i love it “it was a beautiful winter’s day. after getting some shots at the base of cradle mountain, i headed back, but after walking for half an hour i decided it wasn’t the right way. i backtracked and looked up to see a full moon rising. i quickly set up my tripod to capture this amazing sight. i was thinking how fortunate i was that i had taken the wrong track… and then the guide markers disappeared under snow and i became hopelessly lost. i’d started the walk to marions lookout at 1pm; it was now 9pm and i was buggered. i sank to my knees and yelled, ‘help!’ “to my amazement, a male voice replied, ‘are you right, mate?’ he told me to walk towards his torch. “he introduced himself as wes moule and he was going moonlight skiing.he insisted he guide me back over the next 200m as it was very icy. he said he carried 45kg packs to the walkers doing the overland track in summer. i googled wes later and found he was in remission from cancer, and had vowed that for every kilometre walked carrying the packs he would donate $1 to the w. p. holman clinic in launceston. wes walked 1220km in 2010-11, and 1170km in 2011-12. i finally made it back to the car park at 10.30pm. the car was frozen over and the road was iced up but i made it home. then came the hard part: explaining why i was late to my wife!” – jeff crow "
8,"Parachilna Gorge, Flinders Ranges, SA"," east of parachilna, 200km north of port augusta outside the flinders ranges national park how to see it for yourself? reach this scenic outback gorge by turning right at parachilna (if approaching from the south) towards blinman. it’s a dirt road and ok for 2wds unless it’s been raining and the creeks are flowing. you can camp anywhere in the gorge for free at any time of year, but it’s best seen in spring. this region is great for 4wds, with a network of public access routes allowing you to traverse private land – download a map and always check road conditions. parachilna itself is home to not much beyond the prairie hotel, famous for its flinders feral food using local ingredients. why i love it “this is a photo that had existed for years in my mind before it became a reality. travelling along this road, we were caught in the dust of another car when suddenly i saw the possibilities, so we stopped and set up the camera. i asked my assistant to get back into the vehicle and drive by nice and fast. much to his delight we had to do it again and again before the dust, the light and the wind came together.” – ken duncan "
9,"Cathedral Rocks, Kiama"," jones beach, 3km north of kiama how to see it for yourself? kiama is only 120km south of sydney and an easy daytrip through the royal national park and down the pretty south coast, but there’s plenty to see in the area to warrant a longer stay. most visitors are drawn to kiama’s famous blowhole, another product of the ancient volcanic lava flows that also formed cathedral rocks. you’ll find them at the southern end of jones beach, and with a little bit of early morning rockhopping you’ll be able to see them from this angle. by the way, don’t confuse this formation with cathedral rock in northern nsw. why i love it “luring sightseers since 1890, the atmosphere at cathedral rocks is something else. you get a real beginning-of-time feeling when visiting.” – kieran o’connor "
10,"West Island, Cocos (Keeling) Islands"," the cocos (keeling) islands lie 2750km north-west of perth in the indian ocean how to see it for yourself? virgin australia flies to the cocos (keeling) islands from perth via christmas island. comprising the south keeling islands (which ring a central lagoon) and the separate north keeling island, only two of the 27 islands are inhabited. these coral atolls were visited by charles darwin in 1836 and his studies here contributed to his theory on how coral reefs form. the islands were settled for copra production in 1826 and the small population is descended from the original, mostly malay muslim workers. they voted to become part of australia in 1984. a quintessential tropical paradise, you come here to dive, snorkel, camp, surf, kite-surf, birdwatch and chill out, not party. why i love it “the image is taken from the south end of west island looking over the lagoon. sometimes the water is glassed off, sometimes it’s littered with colourful kite-surfing sails, and sometimes it has the most magical sunsets and moon rises! all together on a beautiful and remote tropical island.” – jules bush, cocos keeling islands visitor centre"
11,"Norah Head Lighthouse, NSW"," about 115km north of sydney on the state’s central coast, the lighthouse can be found at 40 bush st, norah head how to see it for yourself? this shot was captured from the north end of soliders beach, looking up to the lighthouse, which can be seen in the distance to the left. there are also amazing views from the lighthouse itself. visitors can have a guided tour around it or even spend the night there, in nearby cottages that were once the lighthouse keeper’s quarters. why i love it “i love the emotion of this scene: the contrast of lights and darks, the newly risen sun in the clouds, the crash of the surf and the shape of the rocks. in the distance stands norah head lighthouse, one of the most recognisable features of the nsw central coast. here its beam farewells the final shadows of night, yet how feeble it appears compared to the glory of the sun.” – ken duncan "
12,"Piccaninny Creek, WA"," near the nt border 300km south of kununurra, the creek cuts through purnululu national park, past the bungle bungles how to see it for yourself? this picture was captured at the end of piccaninny gorge, which visitors can access on a hike of two to seven days via spinifex-covered grasslands and a lookout over the domes. walkers must be fully prepared as they’ll encounter fallen boulders and loose rocks, and there is no reliable drinking water along the way. register at the visitor centre for more info. why i love it “as the sun rises, the awe-inspiring domes of the bungle bungles massif are reflected with unwavering precision in the waters of a pool at the end of piccaninny gorge. weathered over millennia into amazing formations of bandedstone, the domes rise like a stupendous city in the remote north-east of wa. this pool, photographed at the end of the wet season, is likely to last only a month or so before the heat dries it to bare rock. but in the meantime, it awaits the dawning of a new day, adding tranquillity to the harsh world it so delicately mirrors.” – ken duncan "
13,"Mitchell Falls, WA"," in the state’s far north, on the western side of the kimberley, about 15 hours’ drive west of kununurra how to see it for yourself? mitchell plateau is accessible by car during thedry season via an unsealed 4wd track off the gibb river road, along kulumburu road. continue along it, turning at the mitchell plateau track and drive on to the mitchell falls campsite. it is a 3km walk from the campground to the falls, passing a variety of habitats, waterholes and aboriginal rock art. to get another perspective of the mitchell falls, flight tours of the plateau are available with operators such as bush flight and slingair heliwork. why i love it “while camping at mitchell falls we were surrounded throughout the night by fires lit by national park authorities to aid the germination of bush seed. this form of environmental care has been practised by aborigines for millennia. as smoke tempered the early morning light with lovely evenness, the colours of rock and water began to glow. now as i recall this unrepeatable moment, i think of a line from an old song by the eagles – ‘call some place paradise, kiss it goodbye’ – and i pray for the preservation of such unique wilderness.” – ken duncan "
14,"Mossman Gorge, QLD"," in the southern section of the world heritage-listed daintree national park, about 20km west of port douglas in tropical north queensland how to see it for yourself? this image was taken from the base of steps down to the waterhole at mossman gorge. the the best way to see this view first-hand is on fivefoot. guided walks are available, which encompass other sites that are culturally significant to the local kuku yalanji people. the vivid green of the water pictured tends to happen after extended periods without rain. according to the photographer, for ultimate serenity, the best time to visit is early in the morning before the crowds set in. why i love it “towards the end of the dry season the rapids of mossman gorge have usually disappeared. by then, the calm waters offer a perfect place to take a dip and escape the heat of tropical north queensland. i really love this view because the shades of green in the water and surrounding rainforest are truly remarkable.” – mark gray "
15,"Ormiston Gorge, NT"," off namatjira drive, 135km west of alice springs in west macdonnell national park how to see it for yourself? this shot of ormiston gorge was taken from the banks of the creek, a very short walk from the car park. the visitor centre is about 8km from the ormiston gorge turn-off on namatjira drive, and although roads are sealed, they can become impassable after heavy rain. however, the best way to see the gorge is to walk one of the many trails available, ranging from the five minute waterhole walk, which has wheelchair access to the end of the paved path, to the ormiston pound walk, which takes up to four hours to complete. for keen hikers, the larapinta trail also passes through the area, but it is a challenging long-distance walk that requires careful preparation. why i love it “this is classic australian outback country. people often think of the centre of australia as arid, but in the desert there are some beautiful oases and this is one of those places. where there is water, there is life, as evidenced by these graceful old river gums surrounding the waterhole. the creek is fed by spring water, and really only runs after heavy rain. the rich red walls rising up around the creek turn the gorge into a sanctuary – a beautiful place to go for a swim and find relief from the heat.” – ken duncan "
16,"Cape Hauy, TAS"," tasman peninsula, 95km south-east of hobart how to see it for yourself? this view is at the end of the cape, which has a detached sea stack known as the candlestick. these dolerite seacliffs are among the tallest and oldest in australia. kayaking is available with operators such as roaring 40s ocean kayaking. to see it from the land, the cape hauy track is a five-hour return trek that begins in fortescue bay, taking in heath and woodland before the views of the cliffs. why i love it “this breathtaking view gives me a genuine feel for untouched wilderness. even better is the experience of walking along the track through a variety of health and woodland that reaches the magnificent views of steep cliffs and rock formations. the spectacular columns and cliffs surrounded by pristine waters are incredible.” – diane byrne, tourism tasmania "
17,"Mt Feathertop from Mt Hotham, VIC"," in the heart of the australian alps national park, 385km north-east of melbourne how to see it for yourself? you can drive to hotham, at the crest of the great alpine road – the highest bitumen road in australia. there are also several coaches that service the area, such as christian’s bus co and o’connell’s omeo bus service. otherwise, hotham’s airport is serviced by qantaslink from sydney in peak season – the flight takes 80 minutes – and charter flights from across australia year round, and is a handy 20km from the slopes. but while snow-based activities are popular during the winter months, in summer the landscape transforms into grassy mountain ranges speckled in wildflowers. various tracks and trails thread through them, ideal for hiking, biking and horse riding. why i love it “this is one of the most stunning views i have ever seen. to me, this view looking out onto mt feathertop is perfect no matter what time of day or year. whether it is covered in snow or surrounded by blue skies, it can be admired and enjoyed all the time. the sunset here will take your breath away. views like this make working at hotham worthwhile.” – ruth appleyard, mt hotham skiing "
18,"Tantabiddi Sanctuary Zone, WA"," the centre of ningaloo reef, which skirts cape range peninsula, west of exmouth and 1265km north of perth how to see it for yourself? this is a shot of the reefviewer glass-bottomed boat in the centre of the sanctuary. tantabiddi covers only four square kilometres but is home to a wealth of marine life such as green sea turtles, estuary cod, parrotfish and clownfish. ningaloo ecology cruises offers boat and snorkelling tours in the sanctuary, while birds eye view offers microlight flights for great aerial views like this. why i love it this is my office! the beauty of world heritage listed ningaloo reef never ceases to amaze me. with many years on the job as a captain of the boat pictured, this image made me realise again how lucky i am. observing people’s excitement especially kids – is priceless. it stresses the responsibility to pass it on to my children in its stunning untouched state.” – alek nowak, ningaloo ecology cruises "
19,"Cook’s Look, Lizard Island, QLD"," australia’s northernmost island, a 1 hour flight of cairns. how to see it for yourself? after taking the flight to lizard island from cairns, cook’s look can be accessed via a 4 kilometer steep hike to the vantage point. there, panoramic views of the island can be enjoyed, in between snorkels of the great barrier reef of course. why i love it “to call lizard island paradise feels like a gross understatement. rocky outcrops of granite. dry, sparsely vegetated hills. a pleasing barrenness tumbling down to coral-white beaches and aquamarine waters, this lookout encompasses the best of this dry island, which in many ways is reminiscent of the greek islands in the aegean sea” – eliza sholly, deputy digital editor of australian traveller "
20,"Finke River Lookout, NT"," near glen helen resort, 130km west of alice springs on namatjira drive how to see it for yourself? the ancient, 600km finke river rarely flows and is often just a series of waterholes. there’s a permanent one in the gorge at glen helen in west macdonnell national park, which is also one of the few points where you can access the river by sealed road. glen helen resort has motel-style accommodation and camping. why i love it “this scene – typical of the country that inspired albert namatjira – was shot near glen helen. it was one of those rare occasions when the finke river was flowing here. i had already packed up for the day when, suddenly, i saw the sky beginning to colour beautifully. i raced back out just in time to shoot this spectacular view.” – ken duncan "
21,"Bicheno, TAS"," on tasmania’s east coast above wineglass bay, 180km north-east of hobart. how to see it for yourself? this photo is taken directly in front of diamond island resort, at 69 tasman highway, about 2km north of central bicheno, looking north up the coastline. why i love it “the feeling i get from sitting on a rock and taking in the views of this magical sheltered bay is something special. its natural beauty and spectacular landscape offer the most peaceful setting where i can totally relax, reflect and think positive thoughts about the wonderful life i lead.” – diane byrne, tourism tasmania "
22,"Hamersley Dunes, WA"," in the fitzgerald river national park, 550km south-east of perth between albany and esperance how to see it for yourself? fitzgerald river national park contains more than 1800 plant species, 62 unique to the park, and more animal species than any other park in australia. there are entry points on both sides: from the western side via bremer bay, or the eastern side via hopetoun. the central area of the park, however, is only accessible by 4wd or on foot. why i love it “fitzgerald river national park has incredibly diverse scenery. the hamersley dunes are just like a white-sand sahara. there’s 4wd access and great fishing here, but the best catches are often what you capture through the lens.” – elisabeth knowles, editor, australian traveller "
23,"Uluru, NT"," off the lasseter highway, 450km south-west of alice springs how to see it for yourself? the easiest way to see this sacred monolith is to fly direct to ayers rock airport (yulara), which is about 22km north of uluru. alternatively you can drive or catch a tour bus from alice springs with an operator like travel aust (travelaust.com.au), which offers daily transfers. why i love it “indigenous australians believe uluru to be the centre of all dreaming. traditionally, this area was seen as something like the hub of a wheel, with songlines radiating from it across the land. i believe uluru is a place that is special for all australians. i would even go so far as to say that i believe a new ‘song’ is coming – a song of unity and reconciliation between the different cultures of our nation – that will spread powerfully through the rest of the land.” – ken duncan "
24,"The Pinnacles, WA"," nambung national park, 230km north of perth how to see it for yourself? vehicles can access nambung national park from the north via cervantes, or from perth on the scenic indian ocean drive. access to the pinnacles area itself is via a 1.2km marked walk trail or a 4km drive through the park. visit the pinnacles lookout for a more elevated view. why i love it “regarded as one of australia’s most unique landscapes, the pinnacles desert features thousands of golden limestone spires rising eerily out of the sand. you can get up close to the pinnacles, some of which are several metres high, on a scenic drive or walk.” – grace pappelendam, australia’s coral coast "
25,"Wallace Hut, VIC"," near falls creek, 375km north-east of melbourne how to see it for yourself? by car, follow bogong high plains road from falls creek towards omeo – the road is sealed but closes during the winter season, so be prepared. follow the road for about 7.5km and park at the signposted entrance. from there it is an easy 750m walk to the hut. why i love it “this photograph celebrates an era of legends, when cattlemen roamed the high country of australia’s southern range. this hut was one of the men’s old ramshackle resting places. it is captured here in the first light of morning between the spreading snow gums, a scene both of beauty and nostalgia. the good sense of those days is highlighted by the horrendous fires which now so often threaten these protected places. the cattle which once kept the undergrowth in check are gone. many people (myself included) believe they should now be allowed back.” – ken duncan "
26,"Carisbrooke Station, QLD"," off cork mail road, 85km south-west of winton, 970km west of rockhampton how to see it for yourself? from winton, follow kennedy development road in the direction on boulia, then turn left at cork mail road for 45km and the entrance to carisbrooke station is on the left. the station also has a 1100m airstrip, with light aircraft flying to winton. this view was taken from the top of an escarpment that runs parallel to jundah road, bordering the back of the property, looking back towards the station. the escarpment reaches 80m in places, giving great views area. it can be accessed by car from carisbrooke, but it can be limited during the wet season. why i love it “the colours are breathtaking; reds, ochres, whites and shades of green, topped by the clearest of blue skies. during the wet everything is saturated, so the colours seem to “pop” so much more. one can easily find a spot to sit all day to contemplate life and marvel at the beauty of this time-sculpted, ancient landscape.” – ziggy ziegler, the resort "
27,"Lake Oberon, TAS"," the western arthur range, 90km south-west of hobart in southwest national park how to see it for yourself? this picture was taken looking north-west in the 15km-long, 22-peak western arthurs, south of lake pedder in the tasmanian wilderness world heritage area. you access the range from scotts peak dam on a challenging walk of two to three days, or longer to traverse the whole range. tasmanian wilderness experiences offers guided walks through the western arthurs. why i love it “i love the breathtaking scenery in this magical part of the tasmanian wilderness. i can easily spend time watching the wildlife, admiring the scenery and taking a few leisurely walks along the way. this is truly a special place that i can never remove from my mind.” – diane byrne, tourism tasmania "
28,"Bay of Fires, TAS"," on tasmania’s north-east coast, 275km north of hobart how to see it for yourself how to see it for yourself? from st helens (where you should buy food and fuel if camping), take binalong bay road to the signposted turn-off to the gardens, a hamlet at the northern end of the bay of fires conservation area. this is a 13km stretch of coast down to binalong bay that forms the southern section of the bay of fires. why i love it “the landscape is so wild and beautiful. red lichen-covered rocks contrast brilliantly with white sand and turquoise water, and there is so much animal and bird life. if you want a total change from the city, this is the place i’d recommend.” – elisabeth knowles, editor, australian traveller "
