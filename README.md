I am trying to create a chatbot that can assist people in creating a travel plan for people who love to travel.
I am using Llama model for making my chatbot.

Jupyter notebook travel-chatbot-finetunning-with-lora.ipynb has the code to train llm and also the Llama weights are here
I am trying to use image and text prompt both for a better travel recommendation system so that it can help people see their travel plan

The reply I am currently getting from the fine-tuned model is shown below but I want to make a more vivid and descriptive response
